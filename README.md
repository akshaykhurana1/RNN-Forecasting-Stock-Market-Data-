# Forcasting-Stock-Data

In this notebook, I'm demonstrating Recurrent Neural Network for time-series and predictive analysis. Here, I'm using Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU), Long Short Term Memory(LSTM), and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory(BiLSTM) for comparing their performances on NSE Tata stock market data. Then using the best model I'm predicting for next 1 month.
